                Every interaction with your review earns you money. Britevue brings
                a microtransaction-based economy to online reviews. By utilizing
                fast and frictionless digital cash, you earn money when other users
                vote on your review, interact with your review, or leave you a tip
                if they found the review extra helpful.

                  Britevue brings proper incentives to online reviews by allowing

                  can have true data ownership over their intellectual property.

                  Reviewers spend a lot of time leaving thoughtful reviews, but
                  for many consumers itâ€™s not worth the time and effort to leave a
                  high-quality review. In Britevue, every review you leave has the
                  potential to make money. Every interaction with your review
                  earns you revenue.
